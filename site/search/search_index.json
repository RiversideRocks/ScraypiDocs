Tor Blocked on Cloudflare/Akamai sites IPv6 and IPv4 Geolocated mostly in Europe and the United States Mostly datacenter IPs Open Proxy Blocked on Cloudflare sites IPv4 only Geolocation varies Blend of datacenter and residential IPs Private Proxy Blocked on few sites IPv4 and IPv6 (?) Geolocation varies Blend of datacenter and residential IPs Currently all of these routes experience the same cache time, but in the future, harsher cache times may be imposed to reduce load on private proxies. Ratelimiting There is not ratelimiting at the moment. However, responses are cached for 60 seconds. To see if your request has been ratelimited, check the X-Cache header. If it read \"MISS\", it has bypassed the cache. If it reads \"HIT\", it has temporary hit our cache server. If you have a use case that needs this value lowered, please contact us.
